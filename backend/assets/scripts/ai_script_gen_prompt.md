#### 1. `speak`  
- **Purpose**: Spoken dialogue by Jake or Luna  
- **Parameters**:  
  - `speaker`: `"Jake"` or `"Luna"`  
  - `text`: The exact words spoken (no stage directions, no extra formatting)  

**Instruction Template:**  
```json
{
  "tool_name": "speak",
  "tool_params": {
    "speaker": "<Jake or Luna>",
    "text": "<the exact words spoken>"
  }
}
```

**Fleshed-Out Example (Mini Episode):**

[
  {
    "tool_name": "speak",
    "tool_params": {
      "speaker": "Jake",
      "text": "Sup everyone? Welcome back to Cosmic Threads! I’m Jake and I'm stoked for today's episode."
    }
  },
  {

    "tool_params": {
      "speaker": "Luna",
      "text": "And I’m Luna! I'm also super excited to dive into today's topic... once you tell me what it is Jake. Haha!"
    }
  },
  {
    "tool_name": "speak",
    "tool_params": {
      "speaker": "Jake",
      "text": "I love the attitude bruh! So today, I want to talk a bit about what's got to be the coolest thing I've ever seen: supersonic planes."
    }
  },
  {

    "tool_params": {
      "speaker": "Luna",

    }
  },
  // The main content of the podcast episode here //
  {
    "tool_name": "speak",
    "tool_params": {
      "speaker": "Jake",
      "text": "Alright fam. I think that's a wrap on this episode. That time really flew by, huh?"
    }
  },
  {
    "tool_name": "speak",
    "tool_params": {
      "speaker": "Luna",
      "text": "You said it Jake! But thanks so much for hanging around to really dive into it. And thanks to all of you wonderful listeners for sticking around and learning with us! We'll see you all again on Cosmic Threads very, very soon!"
    }
  }
]
```

### Rules & Requirements  

1. **Output only JSON** — no explanations, no markdown delimiters, no extra text.  
2. **Jake always speaks first.**  
3. Both Jake and Luna must introduce themselves before the main discussion.
4. Jake and Luna should alternate turns every 3-5 sentences.
5. The show is always called **"Cosmic Threads"**.  
6. Dialogue must feel **natural, conversational, and engaging**.  
7. Cover all provided key points while staying within the target word count.  
8. In `speak` tool text, include **only the exact spoken words** (no stage directions).  
9. The total length of just the spoken text should equate to a ${{LEN_DEF_WORD_ENGLISH}} podcast. Please refer to this table for what that means.

| Length description | Approx number of turns  | Overall level of detail |
|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Short              | About 15 per host       | Fair                     |
| Medium             | About 30 per host       | High                     |
| Long               | About 50 per host       | Very In-Depth            |

// Please note that one turn is equal to one exchange between Jake and Luna (2 speech tool calls)
